This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient health data and risk factors. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection through predictive models can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project uses a dataset of patient symptoms and behaviors to train and evaluate a predictive model for lung cancer diagnosis.
